Wireframes are blueprints for a website or app, which means they are important in the early stage of design process.One should be noted that even if wireframes display a single interface and map out approximately sizes and content of elements on a page, they do not contain refined design such as colors, font or photos. As a result, wireframes are helpful for everyone to just focus on the information and arrangement on a page and can be revised quickly while the initial discussion keeps going.For my personal experience, I use wireframes to show user flows between views or pages. As the product becomes more complicated, it gets harder to think through the whole user flows and make design process difficult. So using wireframes can really help me to concentrate on the key element and structure, not struggling in the visual design.However, since wireframes are low-fidelity interface, it is hard to impress the stakeholders sometimes. Therefore, we need to explain design decisions — the hierarchy, the page structure, the layout, interactions, etc. to complete the big picture that the wireframe represents. And when do the presentation, try to frame it as a story to get stakeholders into the context. It can help bridge the gap between the wireframe and the intention of the final product. Make wireframes as simple as possible and design monochrome since more colors and messages will induce unnecessary feedback.For further introduction, you can read:UX pin : Wireframing: The Hands-On GuideFrom a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story.Adventurer, UX Designer, PM .
