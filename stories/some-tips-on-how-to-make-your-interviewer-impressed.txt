In the past year, I have interviewed lots of designers in South East Aisa. I found out there are some common questions and myths in their mind after I interviewed them.They might try to figure out: “Hey, Rice. How do I improve my product design portfolio or resume? Should I show all of my skill sets such as Sketch, Photoshop or Flinto in my resume? Or if I know how to use Framer.js, does it have a positive impact on my portfolio?”These are some new designers’ questions, asking how they should improve their portfolio and be ready for their next interview. Actually, before you apply for product design jobs, it’s better to understand what a product designer does. For me, being a product designer is not about receiving requirements and designing wireframes or visualising and building prototypes quickly.Product design is creating something that users LOVE to use. It’s about identifying problems and solving them. A product designer should have multidisciplinary skills and possibly extensive in some areas. They should also know how to design a product from scratch. They can do end to end design beyond just visual design or wireframing. They know how to validate the product by using different design methodologies. They know how to solve problems wisely when they are faced with bottlenecking. Therefore, it’s not just about how many tools you know, but how you designing products people love.Here are some tips I want to highlight here for those who want to make their interviewer impressed.Recently, I received a resume and opened it. I found out they included some courses they took in school. It wasn’t terrible, but please keep in mind — you shouldn’t put what courses you’ve taken before. If you did a project during this course, you can write down your achievements but don’t write down how many credits you earned. Figuring out what kind of content to put in our resume is one of the biggest points of contention and we think about it for a long time. Today, I provide a basic structure for designing your resume.Recently, I received a portfolio and opened it. Frankly, I was shocked by this portfolio — because it was just a wireframe, no description in it.In terms of portfolios you send to the companies — don’t just give them a wireframe or visual outcome without including your thinking.If you get the chance to interview with your dream company, it’s time to prepare your presentation for the first round interview. For me, I would like to choose two or three projects and describe them more in depth. Here’s a typical structure for the product design presentation:Don’t just show a project’s name and your solutions — because we don’t have any context for this project. You need to provide the context to the attendees. Try to tell them the story behind this project or your bottleneck. If the problems you faced are about collaboration with other stakeholders, you should describe how you resolve these conflicts with other teammates. If you have some evidence to prove the success of your design, just put it in. It doesn’t matter if it’s qualitative data or quantitative data.We are not hiring someone who is just good at execution. Design thinking thought, problem-solving capabilities, storytelling, collaboration, system thinking and identifying problems to solutions are some fundamental evaluated points. Talk about the thinking and story behind this project, as well as the most challenging things and how you solved these challenges. 🤘Certainly, it’s common knowledge for designers to put some well-known terms into their portfolio such as contextual inquiry, persona, usability testing, user story, prototyping or information architecture. Using these terms is a way of demonstrating their professional capacity in the product design field.But do they really understand these terms? E.g. Last time I interviewed a designer how do you define your persona? He actually muttered a few words and couldn’t explain it very well. At that moment, my face looked like 👇👇👇Don’t exaggerate about yourself. E.g. Your responsibility in this project should be clarified. It’s not good to exaggerated about your contribution if you only did minor tasks.This article is aimed at helping you get started in the right direction when improving your product design portfolio. These doesn’t cover all the possible tips for the interview. However, it will help you understand basic tips for the interview. 👀From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story.Sr. Product Designer at Grab, previous at @yahoo.
